|                        sqlite_sphere 0.1 for Sqlite3                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


This is a port of the pgSphere 1.1.1 library to Sqlite3. Actually, this is a port
of mysql_sphere to Sqlite3. Ported are all spherical functions but not the spherical 
index part.

Changes:
- made UDF calls coherent
- object wrapping is done using BLOBs that can either be base64 encoded or not
- due to non extensibility of Sqlite3 SQL syntax, no operators are available for
  sphere objects and everything needs to be done using direct UDF function calls

No documentation is available yet, but this will be available in the future.

To install
----------

1) Make sure, the sqlite developer library is installed in your system.

2) If needed, alter CMakeLists.txt (e.g. to disable base64 serialisation)

3) mkdir build
   cd build

4) cmake ..

5) make

6) copy the dynamical library (libsqlitesphere.so or similar) to a convenient place

7) start sqlite3

8) in order to use sqlite_sphere run in sqlite3:
   .load ./libsqlitesphere.so

   according to the place you have put the dynamical library

How to use
----------

See the documentation of mysql_sphere under

         http://escience.aip.de/mysql-sphere

since the libraries are equally used.
